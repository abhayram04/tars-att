The TARS attendance app has been purely in Python (using the latest methods of v3.8). 
It uses the open source library "openpyxl" to handle the data (and its transfer).

For keeping the user data safe & secure, a set of encryption methods of the package "fernet"have been used.
Fernet methods are part of the open source projects pertaining to the "cryptography" library.
